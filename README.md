# hardhat-interact

_Run queries and transactions against contracts using a handy CLI which integrates with your deployments._

A [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org) plugin. 

## What

This plugin implements a CLI to allow you to run read or write queries against your deployed contracts on any network! It uses deployment manifests exported in either hardhat or `truffle` format. This plugin also includes a command to import arbitrary contracts from etherscan as needed.

## Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat-interact @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

Import the plugin in your `hardhat.config.js`:

```js
require("hardhat-interact");
```

Or if you are using TypeScript, in your `hardhat.config.ts`:

```ts
import "hardhat-interact";
```

## Required plugins

- [@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers](https://github.com/nomiclabs/hardhat/tree/master/packages/hardhat-ethers)

## Tasks

This plugin adds the _interact_ task to Hardhat:
```
$ npx hardhat --network mainnet interact

```

Note that the network specified by `--network` above must exist in hardhat configuration, and the network should have a preexisting deployment of your contracts.

Follow the on-screen instructions to select a contract, then a function, and finally the arguments. If its read-only, you can choose to view the return value of the function. If it is a writable, state-changing function, you will be prompted to sign the transaction and submit it to the network.

The interact command supports a few command line arguments. To see an updated list, use `npx hardhat interact --help`.

## Configuration

This plugin extends the `ProjectPathsUserConfig` object with an optional
`deployments` field. This field specifies the location of the deployment artifacts (either `hardhat-deploy` or `truffle` compatible) within your repository. By default, this value is `./deployments/`.

This is an example of how to set it:

```js
module.exports = {
  paths: {
    deployments: "publish/deployed"
  }
};
```
